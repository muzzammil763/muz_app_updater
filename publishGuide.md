# How to Publish a Flutter Package to pub.dev

This guide will walk you through the process of publishing your Flutter package to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/).

## 1. Prepare Your Package

Before you publish your package, make sure you have the following:

*   A `pubspec.yaml` file with the following fields:
    *   `name`: The name of your package.
    *   `version`: The version of your package.
    *   `description`: A short description of your package.
    *   `homepage`: A link to the homepage of your package (e.g., a GitHub repository).
*   A `README.md` file that explains what your package does and how to use it.
*   A `CHANGELOG.md` file that lists the changes in each version of your package.
*   A `LICENSE` file that contains the license for your package.

## 2. Dry Run

Before you publish your package, you should do a dry run to make sure everything is in order. To do this, run the following command in your package's root directory:

```bash
flutter pub publish --dry-run
```

This will check for any errors or warnings in your package.

## 3. Publish

Once you have fixed any errors or warnings, you can publish your package to pub.dev. To do this, run the following command in your package's root directory:

```bash
flutter pub publish
```

This will publish your package to pub.dev.

## 4. Verify

After you have published your package, you should verify that it is available on pub.dev. To do this, go to the following URL:

```
https://pub.dev/packages/<your_package_name>
```

Replace `<your_package_name>` with the name of your package.
